## Introduction
For my third data analysis project, I decided to get back to Maven Analytics to pick a dataset that interests me to work on and I came across this dataset 'Inc 5000 Companies 2019. 

The dataset is supposed to contain information for the 5,000 most successful companies in the United States for each year and in this case the year 2019. After aaccessing the dataset, I found out the companies on the lst are 5,012 instead of 5,000 as implied in the description.

I will analyze to check for any patterns in industries, revenue in the datset and a few other things that will be in the problem statement section of this piece.  

---

## Problem Statement
The problems/questions to be answered in this analysis process are part that came with the dataset and some others that I drew out from the dataset upon assessment

1. What's the average revenue among companies on the list? Broken down by industry? Percentage total of revenue by Industry?
2. Which industries are most and least represented in the list?
3. Do you notice any interesting geographic trends? Top 5 hotspot cities for Inc 5000 Companies?
4. Which industries saw the largest average growth rate? Which companies experienced the highest growth rate? 
5. Which companies had the largest increase in staff/new hires?
6. Did any companies increase revenue while reducing staff?
7. Is there any correlation between revenue and the number of workers in companies?
8. How does the growth rate correlate with the company's years on the list?

## Skills Demonstrated
- Cleaning, transformation of data to a useable structure using Microsoft Excel.
- Calculationo fcorrelation coefficient using Microsoft Excel.
- Analysis of cleaned data using SQL.
- Visualization of data cleaned and analyzed data using Tableau.

---

## Data Sourcing
The dataset was obtained from [Maven Analytics'](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?accessType=open&dataStructure=5wfxyeVf1etbP4TXdyPdG1&page=4) website where datasets are generally available for practice purposes.

---

## Data Assessment and Transformation
### Assessment
The dataset was first assessed using Microsoft Excel. On asssessment, I discovered the dataset had 5,012 rows and 14 columns. 
Below are the columns names and the type of data each contains

- Rank: This is the rank that each company has on the list for that year, the ranks are from 1 to 5,012 and it is given based on the Growth rate each company reached for the year so the company with the highest growth rate ranked number 1.	
- Profile: This contains the link to each company's profile on the Inc 5000 Company List.
- Name: This is the name of the company.
- URL: This holds the link to the company's own website.
- State: It hold the state in which the company is located in.	 
- Revenue: This holds the revenue generated by each company for the year 2019. 	
- Growth_Rate: This shows the growth rate of each company for that year in percentage.	
- Industry: It holds the Industry that each company falls under.	
- Workers: This contains teh total nuimber of workers each compan has. 	
- Previous_Workers: This shows the previous number of workers each company had before laying off or employing more.
- Founded: The year each company was founded is shown in this column.
- Yrs_On_List: This holds the number of years companies have been on the list.	
- Metro: This is the metropolitan area where each company is located.
- City: This is the city where each company is situated.

### Transformation/Cleaning
1. After assessment of the dataset on Microsoft excesl, I had to first check for duplicates since teh descriptuon of the dataset said '5,000' companies but the dataset actually contained 5,012 companies. There were no duplicate companies found.
2. I checked the length of the State column to make sure none exceeded the 2 letter abbreviation used to represent each state and noticed there were none exceeding 2 letter words.
3. I had to add 'https://' to some rows in the URL column that holds the company's website.
4. The data type of the revenue column was changed from number to accounting so it can display the currency side to the left and the revenue in figure to the right of the cells they were contained in.
5. The Industry, Metro and City columns were all changed to proper cases.
6. The growth rate column was changed to percentage while the rank, workers, previous_workers, founded, yrs_on_list wre all converted to number.

That was all for transformation as the dataset was then in a useable format.

## Data Analysis
The dataset was saved and imported into Microsoft SQL Server for the analysis process proper.

1. What's the average revenue among companies on the list? Broken down by industry? Percentage total of revenue by Industry?
- Average revenue
```sql
SELECT ROUND ( AVG (Revenue), 0) Avg_Revenue
FROM SQLPractice.dbo.INC5000
```
| Avg.Rvenue  |
|-------------|
| 47470830.00 |

Above is the average revenue generated by companies on the list for the period and it sums up to forty seven million, four hundred and seventy thousand, eight hundred and thirty Dollars.

6. Did any companies increase revenue while reducing staff?

- From the dataset, it is seen that ‘94’ Inc 5000 Companies reduced their workers. The dataset contains just revenue for the year 2019 so it cannot be compared to previous year to see if there was an increase in revenue despite the reduction in workers.

---

7. Is there any correlation between revenue and the number of workers in companies?

- To find out if there is a correlation between the revenue generated by companies on the Inc 5000 list for 2019 and the number of workers each company had, I calculated the correlation coefficient between Revenue and Workers on Microsoft Excel.
- The correlation coefficient for both variables is 0.27. This is a positive correlation coefficient indicates that as the number of workers increases, the revenue generated also tends to increase. However, it's important to note that the correlation coefficient of 0.27 suggests a relatively weak positive correlation. It implies that there is some association between the two variables, but other factors may also influence the revenue generation of these companies.

---

8. How does the growth rate correlate with the company's years on the list?

- To answer this question, I had to calculate the correlation coefficient between growth rate and the number of years companies have been on the Inc 5000 List to see if there is a correlation between the two variables. This calculation was done using Microsoft Excel.
- The correlation coefficient for both variables is -0.16. This suggests a weak negative correlation between the number of years a company has been on the Inc 5000 List and its Growth rate. This means that as the number of years a company has been on the list increases, its growth rate tends to decrease slightly, although not strongly. It is important to note that the correlation coefficient of -0.16 suggests a weak relationship, which means that the correlation is not particularly strong.
